# RISC-V-out-of-order-execution-at-gem5
The objective of this exercise is to utilize the most popular research microarchitecture simulator, gem5, to examine the differences between an out-of-order execution CPU and an in-order pipelined CPU. Additionally, the exercise aims to evaluate the performance impact of microarchitectural modifications on a program.
